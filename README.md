# emax-chess-zero

A lightweight, modular chess engine written in C, utilizing bitboards and optimized alpha-beta pruning for efficient move generation and game tree search.

## Motivation

This project was initiated as a personal deep dive into how chess engines function at the low level. By building every core component from scratchâ€”including move generation, board evaluation, and searchâ€”I aimed to:

- Understand how bit-level representations improve performance
- Explore the interaction between data structures and algorithms in real-time decision-making
- Practice clean C programming and systems-level optimization

## Features

- Bitboard-based board representation (using `uint64_t`)
- Legal move generation (no pseudolegal filtering)
- Alpha-beta pruning with fixed-depth search
- Basic evaluation function (material + structure)
- Simple command-line interface (UCI-like I/O planned)
- Modular code structure for easy extension

## Build & Run Instructions

### Build

```bash
make
